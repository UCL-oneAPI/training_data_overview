1,"Consider replacing sycl::nd_item::barrier() with
sycl::nd_item::barrier(sycl::access::fence_space::local_space) for better
performance, if there is no access to global memory.
"
2,"The workgroup size passed to the SYCL kernel may exceed the limit.
To get the device limit, query info::device::max_work_group_size. Adjust the
workgroup size if needed.
"
3,"The generated code assumes that ""&g_odata[0]"" points to the
global memory address space. If it points to a local memory address space,
replace ""dpct::atomic_fetch_add"" with ""dpct::atomic_fetch_add<int,
sycl::access::address_space::local_space>"".
"
4,"The generated code assumes that ""&g_odata[1]"" points to the
global memory address space. If it points to a local memory address space,
replace ""dpct::atomic_fetch_sub"" with ""dpct::atomic_fetch_sub<int,

"
5,"The generated code assumes that ""&g_odata[2]"" points to the
